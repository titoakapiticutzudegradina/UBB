# Implement the Chat server example (see the link bellow) using UDP and TCP â€“only this time each client should contact the server just for registration. 
# All communication happens directly between the peers (clients) without passing trough the server. 
# Each client maintains an endpoint (TCP/UDP) with the server just for learning the arrival/departure of other clients. 
# You create a mesh architecture where all clients connect directly between each others.
