1. Provide solutions for the following problems:
  - Write a Java program that prints the prime numbers among the integers numbers given
as command-line parameters.
  - Write a Java program that prints the maximum value from all the double numbers given
as command-line parameters.
  - Write a Java program that prints the greatest common divisor of all integer numbers
given as command-line parameters.

2. Choose one of the problems below and provide a layered architecture solution (in Java). Requirements necessary for the next lab:
- Create the classes necessary for just one entity in the problem requirement (the first mentioned entity).
-	The layers should be: domain, repository, service, UI. Use Java packages.
-	Add at least 5 entities in your memory repository (from source code).
-	All entities should be identifiable (use a generic superclass/interface Identifiable) and unique.
-	The UI must allow CRUD operations for the used entity.

1. Design and implement a Java solution for managing the appointments to a dentist. The program should allow CRUD operations for patients, adding a new appointment, cancelling an appointment, creating different reports, etc.
2. Design and implement a Java solution for managing the orders for birthday-cakes from a cake-shop. The program should allow CRUD operations for birthday-cakes, adding a new order, cancelling an order, finishing an order, creating different reports, etc.
3. Design and implement a Java solution for managing the reservations for car rentals. The program should allow CRUD operations for cars, creating a reservation (rental), cancelling a reservation, creating different reports, etc.
